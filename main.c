// p2_24 following_error

/*

Given the following code snippets, describe the type of the error, and explain what will happen when the program is executed. 

a) int a = 2;
   int b = a / 0;


-> dividing buy zero will cause fatal error .

b) int a = 2;
   if (a = 3) { printf("a is 3"); }
   else { printf("a is not 3"); } 

-> assignment operation in if condition statement will always be true. Hence, it will always print "a is 3".
